      <p>STRANGE BOAT is the story of Danders Wake, a man who has lost faith in the various fundraising efforts and begins raising money to build a new planet. It is a literary and comic take on a growing fascination that our culture has for space travel, the space industry, trips to Mars, survival and escapism. The novel deals with the insanity, speed and ferocity of modern life and the desperate attempts that we all may make to get away.  </p>
      <br>
      <p>The novel will be published by Rare Bird Books in the spring of 2016.

      <p>A PILOT, A JOURNALIST, AND A SEMEN TRAFFICKER WALK ONTO A PLANE ... When flight AW2921 crashes into the Hudson River and all 162 passengers survive, it's a Monday morning miracle. What the rapturous public doesn't know: the whole thing was staged as a last-ditch attempt at resurrecting the Air Wanderlust stock price. </p>

      <p>"The cheeky send-up is aggressively experimental, but Methven manages to tell an engaging story amid the antic high jinks. B+" - Entertainment Weekly </p>
      <br>
      <p>"Relentlessly inventive. . . . Beneath the snappy dialogue and quirky plot twists, Methven is posing a profound question: What happens when a country can no longer live up to its own mythos? . . . Methven keeps the plot humming, all the way to the sticky end. He's an exciting new voice." - Steve Almond, The Boston Globe</p>
      <br>
      <p>"A Pynchonesque, offbeat parody of American media coverage and celebrity. . . . a smart, fast-paced farce in which Methven ably satirizes Americaâ€™s signature take on reality and culture of greed." - Booklist</p>
      <br>
      <p>"Every so often a first novel comes along that blows your hair back with its ingenuity, that jumpstarts your faith in imaginative literature, and Jon Methven has written one of those novels. This Is Your Captain Speaking is an astonishing debut, a comedic masterwork worthy of the great Joe Orton and Stanley Elkin. Outrageous and gorgeously absurd, it shows us, with fearless accuracy, what a twisted tribe we have become." -" William Giraldi, author of Busy Monsters</p>
