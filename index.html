	<h1>About Jon Methven</h1>
	<p>I'm a writer, living in New York City. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because I use it both in my writing career and my day job (a newsroom editor). </p>

	<h2>My Mission</h2>
	<p>As I learn more about front-end, I hope to one day work as a full-time writer implementing this knowledge across digital media platforms. These skills will allow me to improve my <a href="http://www.jonmethven.com/">personal website</a> and also have the knowledge to discuss coding professionally. My ideal work environment is working from home.</p>
